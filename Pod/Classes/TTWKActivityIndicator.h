/** 
 * Simplifies creating of Apple Watch style activity animations at run time, 
 * so there is no need to store prerendered image in the app's bundle in advance.
 *
 * It still uses the on-device image cache, so rendering will be delayed only the first time
 * an indicator of a given size/color/style is set.
 *
 * It's not the actual control (since you cannot have custom controls on Apple Watch yet), 
 * but rather a helper that is used to prerender a sequence of images (as a single 'animated' instance of UIImage) 
 * which then is fed to WKInterfaceImage or as a background image of WKInterfaceGroup.
 *
 * The helper can be also be used with regular iOS apps within drawRect:, in which case the initial 'fade in'
 * sequence can be also animated. (The initial animation sequence cannot be used on Apple Watch yet, 
 * because there is no way to loop an image animation from a non-first frame.) See TTWKActivityIndicatorView 
 * in this pod for an implementation suitable for normal iOS apps.
 *
 * To use this helper with WatchKit you'll need to add a WKInterfaceImage or WKInterfaceGroup into your storyboard
 * (this is where the indicator will appear), then create an instance of TTWKActivityIndicator and use its 
 * setToGroupOrImage: method to transfer the animated image. For example (assuming self.activityIndicator is 
 * WKInterfaceGroup or WKInterfaceImage in your controller):
 *
 * \begincode
 * TTWKActivityIndicator *indicator = [[TTWKActivityIndicator alloc]
 *     initWithColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:1.0000 green:0.8824 blue:0.1020 alpha:1.0]
 *     bubbleRadius:2
 * ];
 * [indicator setToGroupOrImage:self.activityIndicator];
 * \endcode
 *
 * Of course the image or group in your storyboard should be of proper size (or have it set to 'size fit the contents')
 * and it should have approprtiate mode, such as Center.
